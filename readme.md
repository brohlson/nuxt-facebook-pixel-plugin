# Nuxt Facebook Pixel Plugin

This plugin was created based on the example for Google Analytics in the Nuxt.js docs. Basically you're calling the `fbq(track)` each time the route changes.

- Add `facebook-pixel.js` to your `/plugins` dir
- Add your Facebook Pixel ID
- Include the plugin in `nuxt.config.js`
